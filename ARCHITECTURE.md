# n-eda Architecture

How the runtime actually works. For the API, see [README.md](README.md); for the rules you must obey
when writing against it, see [llms.txt](llms.txt).

## It is not Redis Streams

Despite the vocabulary — topics, partitions, consumer groups, offsets — n-eda does not use Redis
Streams, `XADD`, `XREADGROUP`, or Redis consumer groups. It implements a log by hand out of four
primitives:

- `INCR` on a per-partition **write index** to allocate a slot
- `SETEX` of a **deflate-compressed JSON array** into that slot
- `MGET` of a window of slots by the consumer
- `PUBLISH`/`SUBSCRIBE` on a per-partition channel as a low-latency doorbell

Understanding that shape explains most of the system's behavior, including its sharpest edges.

## Redis keys

All partition-scoped keys share a Redis Cluster **hash tag** — the `{...}` prefix — so every key for a
given topic-partition lands in the same slot and multi-key reads are cluster-legal.

| Key | Type | TTL | Written by | Read by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `{n-eda-<topic>-<partition>}-write-index` | string (int) | **none** | producer (`INCR`) | consumer (`MGET`) |
| `{n-eda-<topic>-<partition>}-<N>` | binary blob | `topic.ttlMinutes * 60` | producer (`SETEX`) | consumer (`MGET`/`GET`) |
| `{n-eda-<topic>-<partition>}-<group>-read-index` | string (int) | **none** | consumer | consumer |
| `{n-eda-<topic>-<partition>}-<group>-tracked_keys` | list | **none** | consumer (`LPUSH`/`LTRIM`) | consumer (`LRANGE`) |
| `{n-eda-<topic>-<partition>}-changed` | pub/sub channel | n/a | producer (`PUBLISH`) | `Monitor`, on a duplicated connection |
| `n-eda-observable-<Type>.<id>.<Event>` | set | **none** | `subscribeToObservables` (`SADD`) | `publish` (`SCARD`, `SMEMBERS`) |

Members of the observable set are `` `${observerTypeName}.${observerId}` ``.

> **Only the payload keys expire.** The write index, read index, and tracked-keys lists are immortal by
> design. Run Redis with `maxmemory-policy noeviction` — if the write index is evicted it resets to `0`
> while the read index stays high, making `readIndex >= writeIndex` permanently true. Consumption then
> stops silently and forever, with no error anywhere.

> The observable set keys carry **no hash tag**, so under Redis Cluster they scatter across slots.

There is a second, internal key format — `` `${topic}+++${partition}` `` — that never touches Redis. It
is a `Map` key in the producer registry and the value of the OpenTelemetry
`messaging.destination.name` attribute. Easy to mistake for a Redis key when reading traces.

## Publishing

`RedisEventBus.publish(topic, ...events)`:

1. Guard: not disposed; `topic` is a registered topic name; `topic` is not the distributed-observer topic.
2. Bucket the events by partition.
   - `NedaClearTrackedKeysEvent` is special-cased and **fanned out to every partition**.
   - An event whose `name` is not in `manager.eventMap` is **dropped**, unless the topic was
     `.forcePublish()`ed.
   - Otherwise `partition = mapToPartition(topic, event)`.
3. If nothing was bucketed, **return early** — note this skips the observer fan-out below.
4. One `Producer.produce(...)` per partition, all in parallel.
5. Distributed-observer fan-out, if enabled (see below).

`Producer.produce`:

```typescript
const compressed = await this._compressEvents(serialized);          // deflateRaw(JSON.stringify(array))
const writeIndex = await Make.retryWithExponentialBackoff(() => this._incrementPartitionWriteIndex(), 5)();
await Make.retryWithExponentialBackoff(() => this._storeEvents(writeIndex, compressed), 5)();
```

```typescript
private async _storeEvents(writeIndex: number, eventData: Buffer): Promise<void>
{
    const key = `${this.id}-${writeIndex}`;

    await this._client
        .pipeline()
        .setex(key, this._ttlSeconds, eventData)
        .publish(`${this.id}-changed`, this.id)
        .exec();
}
```

**One write-index slot holds one entire `publish()` batch for that partition, not one event.** A single
`publish(topic, ...10_000 events)` writes at most `numPartitions` Redis keys. This is why the consumer's
`maxRead = 50` means 50 *batches*, not 50 events.

**The `INCR` and the `SETEX` are two separate round-trips**, each independently retried. A consumer can
observe an allocated index whose payload has not landed yet — which is exactly what the consumer's
200-attempt read-retry loop exists to absorb.

## The consume loop

`Consumer._beginConsume`, per (topic, partition, consumer group):

1. `MGET` the write index and this group's read index together (same hash tag, so one round-trip).
2. Report lag to the `Broker` at most once per half metrics interval (30 s by default) — but only
   between batches, so a loop blocked in the handler retry ladder pauses reporting. The
   `MetricsReporter` logs those figures one flat line per partition — see
   [docs/observability.md](docs/observability.md).
3. If `readIndex >= writeIndex`, sleep a jittered `randomInt(2500, 5000)` ms on a cancellable delay and
   loop. The `Monitor`, subscribed to the `-changed` channel, cancels that delay the instant a producer
   publishes — so steady-state latency is sub-millisecond and the 2.5–5 s figure is only a fallback.
4. Otherwise compute the read window:

```typescript
const maxRead = 50;
const depth = writeIndex - readIndex;
const lowerBoundReadIndex = readIndex + 1;
let upperBoundReadIndex = writeIndex;
if (depth > maxRead)
{
    upperBoundReadIndex = readIndex + maxRead;

    if (depth > depthWarningThreshold) // 500
        await this._logger.logWarning(
            `Event queue depth for ${this.id} (consumer ${this._manager.consumerName} [${this._manager.consumerGroupId}]) is ${depth}.`);
}
```

5. One `MGET` for the whole window.
6. **Flush mode** (`Topic.flushConsume()`): advance the read index, `UNLINK` the keys, loop. No handler runs.
7. For each slot with a null value, retry `GET` up to **200 attempts** (100 ms for the first 50, then
   250 ms) — worst case ≈ 42 s for a single missing slot. On give-up: log, advance the read index by
   one, continue.
8. `inflateRaw` → `JSON.parse` → `Deserializer.deserialize` each event.
9. Skip any event id already in the tracked-keys set.
10. Resolve the handler registration. For the distributed-observer wrapper this means rebuilding the
    observation key from the wrapper's `observerTypeName` plus the inner event's `refType` and `name`.
    **If no registration matches, the event is marked processed and skipped** — this is deliberate, so a
    rolling deployment where one replica does not yet know an event type does not stall.
11. Route every event in the batch **concurrently**, then `await Promise.all(...)`.
12. Save tracked keys, advance the read index to the window's upper bound, and — if `cleanUpKeys()` was
    configured — `UNLINK` the payload keys.

Any throw in the loop body logs, sleeps 5 s, and retries **without advancing the read index**.

## Dispatch: route → schedule → process

`Broker.route` hands the work item to `OptimizedScheduler.scheduleWork`, which returns a `Deferred`.

The scheduler keeps one queue per partition key and a `Set` of partition keys currently in flight:

```typescript
private readonly _processing = new Set<string>();
```

A partition key is admitted only when it is not already in that set. **This is where ordering comes
from**: at most one work item per partition key executes at any moment, process-wide. Different
partition keys run concurrently, bounded by the number of `Processor` instances — which equals the
number of partitions this process owns for the topic.

`DefaultProcessor.processEvent` is where DI happens:

```typescript
const scope = this.manager.serviceLocator.createScope();
(<any>event).$scope = scope;

this._onEventReceived(scope, workItem.topic, event);        // RedisEventSubMgr sets EdaContext.topic

const handler = scope.resolve(workItem.eventRegistration.eventHandlerTypeName);
try { await handler.handle(event, observerId); }
finally { await scope.dispose(); }
```

One child DI scope per event delivery, disposed in `finally`. The handler is resolved **by its class
name**, which is why handler class names must be globally unique.

> `$scope` is stapled onto the event object and the scope is disposed when `handle()` returns. Holding a
> reference to the event past `handle()` gives you a disposed container.

## Delivery guarantees and failure modes

**At-least-once**, deduped best-effort.

The dedupe window is the tracked-keys list: last **1000 event ids** per (topic, partition, consumer
group), trimmed from 3000 down to 1000 whenever it grows past the ceiling. Anything older than that
window will be re-delivered if the read index ever rewinds. **Handlers must be idempotent.**

Handler failures retry inside the processor:

```typescript
const maxProcessAttempts = 10;
const seconds = (5 + numProcessAttempts) * numProcessAttempts;   // [6, 14, 24, 36, 50, 66, 84, 104, 126]
```

10 attempts, 9 sleeps, **510 seconds ≈ 8 min 30 s** total.

| Scenario | Outcome |
|---|---|
| Handler throws once | Retried after 6 s, same processor, same event object. |
| Handler always throws | 10 attempts over ~8.5 min, then logged and **dropped**. No dead-letter queue. |
| Does a poison event block the partition? | **Yes, for ~8.5 min.** The consumer awaits the whole batch before advancing the read index, and the partition key stays locked in `_processing` throughout. Not forever, but long. |
| Crash mid-batch | The read index never advanced, so the batch replays. Tracked keys suppress the duplicates within the 1000-event window. |
| Broker disposed mid-flight | `ObjectDisposedException` → the event is deliberately **not** tracked, so it replays on restart. This is the graceful-shutdown path. |

Five paths degrade to **at-most-once** — the event is skipped and the read index advances:

1. Retry exhaustion (10 failed attempts).
2. No handler registration for the event name (rolling deploy).
3. `Topic.flushConsume()`.
4. Read-retry exhaustion (200 attempts, payload never appeared).
5. TTL expiry before the consumer got there.

> **A consumer group offline longer than the topic TTL crawls rather than skips.** Every expired slot
> costs the full 200-attempt ladder — roughly 42 seconds — before the consumer gives up and advances a
> single index. A few thousand expired slots is indistinguishable from a hang.

## Partitioning and scaling

```typescript
public mapToPartition(topic: string, event: EdaEvent): number
{
    const partitionKey = this._partitionKeyMapper(event).trim();
    return MurmurHash.x86.hash32(partitionKey) % this._topicMap.get(topic)!.numPartitions;
}
```

MurmurHash3 x86 32-bit, seed 0, modulo `numPartitions`. No consistent hashing, no virtual nodes —
**changing `numPartitions` reshuffles every key**, breaks per-key ordering across the change, and
strands in-flight events in partitions no one reads.

Consumer assignment is **static and manual**. `RedisEventSubMgr.consume()` creates one `Consumer` and
one `Processor` per partition — every partition, unless `configurePartitionAffinity` narrows the range.
There is no group coordination, ownership lease, heartbeat, or rebalancing.

Consequences:

- Concurrency per process = partitions owned, per topic.
- Two replicas in the same consumer group without disjoint affinity **both** read the same window and
  **both** dispatch. Their tracked-key sets are loaded once at boot and never reconciled, so this
  produces genuine duplicate processing.
- Scaling out means editing configuration:

```typescript
new Topic("orders", Duration.fromHours(4), 100).subscribe().configurePartitionAffinity("0-49");   // replica A
new Topic("orders", Duration.fromHours(4), 100).subscribe().configurePartitionAffinity("50-99");  // replica B
```

> The partition key is computed twice and inconsistently: `mapToPartition` trims it for Redis routing,
> while the consumer uses the untrimmed value as the scheduler's ordering key. A mapper that returns
> padded strings yields two different keys.

## Distributed observer

A second routing layer, orthogonal to topics: it delivers events from **one specific instance** of a
remote entity to the subscribers watching that instance.

**Subscribe** (observer side) — validates that a local handler exists for the observation key
`` `.${observer}.${observable}.${event}` ``, then `SADD`s `` `${observerType}.${observerId}` `` into
`n-eda-observable-<ObservableType>.<observableId>.<ObservableEventType>`.

**Fan-out** (observable side) — on every `publish()`, for each event:

```typescript
const observableKey = this._generateObservableKey({
    observableType: event.refType, observableId: event.refId, observableEventType: event.name });

const hasSubs = await this._checkForSubscribers(observableKey);        // SCARD
if (hasSubs)
{
    const subs = await this._fetchSubscribers(observableKey);          // SMEMBERS
    // wrap in NedaDistributedObserverNotifyEvent, map to the observer topic's partition, produce
}
```

This is why `EdaEvent` requires `refId` and `refType` — they are the observable's identity. The wrapper
event uses `observerId` as its partition key, so all notifications for one observer are serialized.

**Delivery** — the consumer recognizes the wrapper by name, rebuilds the observation key, and
`DefaultProcessor` unwraps the inner event before calling `handle(observedEvent, observerId)`.

Two costs worth knowing: the fan-out is `SCARD` + `SMEMBERS` **per event, sequentially awaited**, so
publishing N events adds up to 2N serial round-trips; and the early return in step 3 of publishing means
a pure-publisher service never fans out at all. See [docs/known-issues.md](docs/known-issues.md).

## OpenTelemetry

Tracer name is always `"n-eda"`. Three spans per event, chained producer → receive → process. W3C
context travels in a `$traceData` property injected into the serialized event body by the producer and
extracted by the consumer.

| Span | Name | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| publish | `event.<EventName> publish` | `PRODUCER` |
| receive | `event.<EventName> receive` | `INTERNAL` |
| process | `event.<EventName> process` | `CONSUMER` |

All three carry `messaging.system` = `"n-eda"`, `messaging.operation.type`, `messaging.destination.name`
= `` `${topic}+++${partition}` ``, `messaging.destination.temporary` = `false`,
`messaging.message.id` = `event.id`, and `messaging.message.conversation_id` = `event.partitionKey`.

The **receive** span covers the scheduler queue wait *and* the entire retry ladder, so a poison event
produces an ~8.5-minute span.

> On retry and on exhaustion, n-eda writes the **full serialized event payload** into span events, span
> status messages, and log lines. Events carrying personal data will leak it into telemetry.

## Tuning constants

All hardcoded; none are configurable at runtime.

| Value | Location | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `"n-eda"` | `consumer.ts`, `producer.ts` | Redis key prefix, tracer name, `messaging.system` |
| `maxRead = 50` | `consumer.ts` | max write-index slots (batches) per poll |
| `depthWarningThreshold = 500` | `consumer.ts` | per-read backlog warning; decoupled from `maxRead` so routine catch-up stays quiet |
| `maxReadAttempts = 200` @ 100/250 ms | `consumer.ts` | payload-not-yet-written retry; ≈42 s worst case per slot |
| `randomInt(2500, 5000)` ms | `consumer.ts` | idle poll jitter, cancelled by the pub/sub doorbell |
| `Delay.seconds(5)` | `consumer.ts` | backoff after an unexpected consume-loop error |
| `_maxTrackedSize = 3000` / `_keepTrackedSize = 1000` | `consumer.ts` | dedupe window; `LTRIM 0 999` |
| `maxProcessAttempts = 10`, `(5+n)*n` s | `processor.ts` | handler retry ladder, 510 s total |
| `retryWithExponentialBackoff(..., 5)` | `producer.ts` | 6 attempts each for `INCR` and `SETEX` |
| `Duration.fromHours(1)` | `optimized-scheduler.ts` | empty-queue GC sweep |
| `Duration.fromMinutes(1)` default | `metrics-reporter.ts` | metrics log cadence; override with `configureMetricsInterval` |
| half the metrics interval | `consumer.ts` | lag report cadence, derived so no logged line is more than one report stale |
| `maxAcceptableLag = 1000` | `metrics-reporter.ts` | per-tick lag warning threshold |
| `connectionPoolSize` default `50` | `grpc-client-factory.ts` | round-robin gRPC client pool |
| `AbortSignal.timeout(60000)` | `rpc-proxy-processor.ts` | HTTP RPC timeout (gRPC has **no** deadline) |
| 2 s dev / 10 s otherwise | `redis-event-bus.ts` | event bus dispose drain |
| 2 s dev / 15 s otherwise | `rpc-server.ts`, `grpc-server.ts` | server connection drain |

## Connections and operations

- **One shared `ioredis` client** (`"EdaRedisClient"`) serves every producer and consumer. The `Monitor`
  calls `client.duplicate()` for its pub/sub subscriber, because subscribe mode monopolizes a
  connection. Size your Redis connection limits with partition count in mind.
- **`RedisEventBus.dispose()` does not close the Redis client** — it drains, then flips a flag.
  Connection lifecycle belongs to your app; register a `Disposable` alongside the client.
- **Redis Cluster** works for the topic-partition keys thanks to hash tags; the observable set keys are
  unhashed and scatter.
- **`cleanUpKeys()` deletes payloads immediately after this group's read index advances.** With a second
  consumer group on the same topic, it deletes data that group has not read yet.
