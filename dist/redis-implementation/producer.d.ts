/**
 * Writes events to one partition of one topic.
 *
 * The write path: serialize each event (injecting W3C trace context as `$traceData`), deflate the whole batch
 * as a single JSON array, `INCR` the partition's write index to allocate a slot, `SETEX` the compressed blob
 * into that slot with the topic's TTL, and `PUBLISH` a doorbell so an idle consumer wakes immediately.
 *
 * RULE: one write-index slot holds **one entire `publish()` batch**, not one event. Both Redis calls are
 * separately retried with exponential backoff, and because they are distinct round-trips a consumer can
 * observe an allocated index before its payload exists.
