/**
 * Runs one work item at a time, applying the retry policy that defines n-eda's failure semantics.
 *
 * Retry ladder: **10 attempts**, sleeping `(5 + n) * n` seconds between them — `6, 14, 24, 36, 50, 66, 84,
 * 104, 126` — about **8 minutes 30 seconds** in total. On the final failure the work item's deferred is
 * rejected; the consumer then logs, marks the event processed, and moves on. **There is no dead-letter
 * queue.**
 *
 * Note: a failing event holds its partition key locked for the whole ladder, stalling that key's queue and
 * its consumer's batch window. Every attempt logs the full serialized event payload, and the exhaustion path
 * writes it into span attributes too — a consideration if events carry personal data.
 *
 * Subclasses supply the actual dispatch: `DefaultProcessor` runs handlers in-process; the proxy processors
 * forward to Lambda, RPC, or gRPC.
