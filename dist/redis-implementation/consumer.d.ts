/**
 * Reads one partition of one topic for one consumer group, and routes what it finds to the broker.
 *
 * The loop: `MGET` the write and read indexes; if caught up, sleep on a cancellable delay that the `Monitor`
 * interrupts on a pub/sub doorbell; otherwise `MGET` a window of at most 50 slots, inflate and deserialize
 * each batch, skip ids already in the dedupe set, route the rest concurrently, then advance the read index.
 *
 * Contract: the read index advances only after every routed event settles, so a crash mid-batch replays that
 * batch. Deduplication is a rolling window of the last 1000 event ids per (topic, partition, group),
 * persisted as a Redis list and reloaded at startup. Events whose handler registration is missing are marked
 * processed and skipped — deliberate, so a rolling deployment does not stall.
 *
 * Note: a slot whose payload has not landed yet is retried up to 200 times (≈42 s) — this absorbs the race
 * between the producer's `INCR` and its `SETEX`, which are separate round-trips.
