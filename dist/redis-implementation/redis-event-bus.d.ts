/**
 * The Redis-backed `EventBus` — the only shipped implementation.
 *
 * Contract: register the **class** with `EdaManager.registerEventBus(RedisEventBus)`. It is
 * `@inject("EdaRedisClient")`, and resolves `"Logger"` from the container during `initialize`, so both DI
 * keys must be registered by your `ComponentInstaller`.
 *
 * Storage model: events are bucketed by partition, each partition's batch is deflate-compressed and stored
 * under a single `INCR`-allocated slot (`SETEX`), and a pub/sub doorbell wakes the matching consumer. See
 * `ARCHITECTURE.md` for the full key layout.
 *
 * Note: `dispose()` drains for a few seconds and flips a flag — it does **not** close the Redis client.
 * Register a `Disposable` alongside the client so the connection is actually torn down.
