/**
 * The Redis-backed `EventSubMgr` — the only shipped implementation, and the process that actually runs
 * handlers in-process.
 *
 * Contract: register the **class** with
 * `EdaManager.registerEventSubscriptionManager(RedisEventSubMgr, consumerGroupId)`. It is
 * `@inject("EdaRedisClient", "Logger")`, so both DI keys must be registered by your `ComponentInstaller`.
 *
 * On `consume()` it creates, for every topic that is neither disabled nor publish-only, one `Consumer` and
 * one `Processor` per owned partition — all partitions unless `Topic.configurePartitionAffinity` narrowed
 * the range — plus a `Broker` per topic, and process-wide a `Monitor` and a `MetricsReporter`.
 *
 * Note: this is the only path that populates `EdaContext`. If every registered topic is publish-only or
 * disabled while a subscription manager is registered, `consume()` throws, because the `Monitor` requires a
 * non-empty consumer list and the `MetricsReporter` a non-empty broker list.
