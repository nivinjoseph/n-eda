/**
 * The root object of an n-eda application: a dependency-injection container wrapper that owns topic and
 * handler configuration, and drives the publish/consume lifecycle.
 *
 * Lifecycle, in order:
 * 1. `new EdaManager(container?)` — also registers `"EdaContext"` scoped.
 * 2. Configuration — every `use*` / `register*` / `proxyTo*` / `actAs*` method, in any order among
 *    themselves, but **all before** `bootstrap()`. Each returns `this` for chaining.
 * 3. `await bootstrap()` — requires at least one topic and a registered event bus.
 * 4. `beginConsumption()` — only if an `EventSubMgr` was registered. **Do not await it.**
 * 5. `await dispose()`.
 *
 * Contract: the container must be able to resolve `"EdaRedisClient"` (an `ioredis` `Redis`) and `"Logger"`
 * (an n-log `Logger`) — supply both through a `ComponentInstaller` passed to
 * {@link EdaManager.useInstaller}. The DI keys n-eda reserves are `"EventBus"`, `"EventSubMgr"`,
 * `"EdaContext"`, and every registered handler's class name.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const topic = new Topic("user", Duration.fromHours(1), 25).subscribe();
 *
 * const edaManager = new EdaManager();
 * edaManager
 *     .useInstaller(new CommonComponentInstaller())
 *     .registerTopics(topic)
 *     .registerEventHandlers(UserCreatedEventHandler)
 *     .registerEventBus(RedisEventBus)
 *     .registerEventSubscriptionManager(RedisEventSubMgr, "user-service-group");
 *
 * await edaManager.bootstrap();
 * edaManager.beginConsumption().catch(e => console.error(e));   // never awaited
 * ```
